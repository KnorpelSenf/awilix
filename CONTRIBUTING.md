# Contributing

Clone repo, run `npm install` to install all dependencies, run `npm run build` to create an initial build, and then
`npm run test -- --watchAll` to start writing code.

For code coverage, run `npm run cover`.

If you submit a PR, please aim for 100% code coverage and no linting errors.
Travis will fail if there are linting errors. Thank you for considering
contributing. :)
